2020-04-22 12:02:50 1460     [INFO] This design's .HYP file was created by a PCB translator that did not record whether the physical information is sufficiently detailed for power-integrity analysis (especially metal areas and via clearances).  Most likely, the translator was an older version not upgraded for PI usage.  PI simulation may therefore produce less-accurate results.
